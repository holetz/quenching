"""The OKF conformance vocabulary — the reserved names, the exempt ones, the recommended
fields, and the two glob tables every check agrees on.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor OKF validator script, with TWO adjustments: `VERSION` is
imported from `quenching.common.version` rather than declared a second time, and `HERE`
is gone — it was dead in the original, computed at import and read by nothing.

THE CONFORMANCE CORE (single source — mirrored in the skills' `references/conformance.md`)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reserved filenames: `index.md` (a listing), `log.md` (a retired change history).
Exempt (skipped): harness pointer files (never OKF concepts).
`README.md` in the bundle → WARN (OKF-strict converts it to `index.md`).
- Every **non-reserved** `.md`  → MUST have parseable YAML frontmatter (ERROR if
  absent/broken) with a **non-empty `type`** (ERROR if missing/empty). Recommended
  fields (`title`/`description`/`resource`/`generated`) missing → WARN. A legacy
  `timestamp` still satisfies the recency recommendation (OKF v0.2 fallback).
- Every **`index.md`**          → MUST NOT carry a concept `type` (ERROR). A
  **non-root** `index.md` MUST carry no frontmatter at all (ERROR). The **root**
  `index.md` (at the bundle root) MAY carry frontmatter but only `okf_version`
  (other keys → WARN); it SHOULD declare `okf_version: "0.2"` (0.1 is read; any
  other value → WARN).
- **OKF v0.2 families** (all optional) — `sources`, `generated`, `verified`,
  `status`, `stale_after`, and the `Attested Computation` keys (`runtime`,
  `parameters`, `computation`, `executor`, `attester`). Their absence is not a
  finding; when present they are checked for shape, not for content.
- Every **`log.md`**            → **retired**. Nothing produces it and nothing checks
  it, but the name stays reserved and stays out of the hard block, so a log surviving
  in an already-aligned bundle is recognized rather than read as a malformed concept
  doc. Retired is not unknown.

The bundle root is the fixed `/docs/` convention — no knob names it, and no config moves it.
