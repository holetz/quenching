"""The merge of quenching's own hooks and `attribution` into a target's `.claude/settings.json`.

Pure: it takes the current text (or None) and the wanted entries and returns the new text, or
refuses. The file belongs to the user; only the entries whose command points under
`.agents/quenching/assets/hooks/` are quenching's, and that path is the marker that identifies them
even when no deploy manifest exists.
