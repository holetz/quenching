"""Composition — a spec whose `## Tasks` items may name member specs, derived and never ticked.

Pure derivation, no backend and no I/O: the caller hands over the composite's `info` and the
members' `info` rows it read, and gets the state back. That is what keeps one answer across the
memory fake, the git store and the tracker backends.

A spec item reads `- [ ] S2 Title — spec: #1202 — after: S1,S3`; a member kept in another
repository's store reads `— spec: <owner>/<repo>#<id>`, and its key keeps that form (owner and
repo lower-cased) so it never collides with a local id. The `### N.` headings above the items
are its waves. The item's state is DERIVED from the member document: done when the member is
archived with `outcome: done` (and, when its PR is known, merged: `unmerged` otherwise),
blocked when one of its tasks is `[!]`. The box written in the composite is never read as
state, which is why `task` refuses a spec item.

Composition is a PROPERTY, not a type: any spec with at least one spec item is a composite,
may nest, and may belong to several composites. `workItemType: epic` no longer defines it."""
