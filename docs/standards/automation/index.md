# `standards/automation/`

How this repo's Claude Code **automation surface** — skills and their command wrappers — is
classified, named, authored, and swept into conformance.

**Boundary:** `automation/` governs the `.claude/`-style skill + command surface (here, the
plugin's own `skills/` + `commands/`). The naming of the commands themselves lives one level over
in [../naming/command-surface.md](../naming/command-surface.md); code conventions live in
[../code/](../code/index.md). One standard per file; each carries `type: standard` + a derived
`resource:`.
