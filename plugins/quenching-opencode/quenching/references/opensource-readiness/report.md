# Pre-publication readiness: evidence, report and disposition

<!-- rules -->

This file owns the `pr-*` codes of `cq opensource readiness`, the evidence each class accepts and
the shape of the report `quenching-opensource-readiness` builds from it. Readiness is a
separate assessment from the baseline: it never converts into an OSPS level, and the catalog in
[`opensource-controls/catalog.md`](../opensource-controls/catalog.md) never reads it.

## The assessed scope

The route assesses the target's committed content: the `HEAD` tree and the reachable history of
every local branch and tag. `scope` returns the exact refs and commits, whether the clone is
shallow and whether every reachable object is present (`historyComplete`). Untracked and ignored
files are counted and never scanned (`untrackedScanned: false`); they are not part of what would be
published, and they are not represented as history either.

The route never fetches, never changes a ref, never writes to the target and never runs a target
script: every git call, its own and the scanners', runs with `core.fsmonitor=false` and an empty
hooks path. Scanner reports go to a disposable directory outside the target, deleted when the
assessment ends; a scratch directory that resolves inside the target refuses the scanner
(`pr-scratch-inside-target`).

## Classes and their evidence

| Class | Evidence | Measured when | Finding | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `secrets` | `gitleaks` ≥ 8.19 (`git` subcommand, `--redact`, branches and tags), else `trufflehog` 3.x (`--no-verification --no-update`) | a supported scanner completed over complete history | `pr-secret` | blocker |
| `internal-identifiers` | `git grep` over `HEAD` for internal host suffixes and private IPv4 ranges; author and committer addresses of the reachable history | both reads completed over complete history | `pr-internal-identifier`, `pr-identity-in-metadata` | warning |
| `dependency-license` | the owner's reviewed evidence file | the evidence names a state and a reviewer | `pr-license-incompatible` | blocker |
| `attribution` | `reuse lint --json` ≥ 2, tracked files only | reuse completed | `pr-attribution-missing`, `pr-license-text-missing` | blocker |
| `large-generated` | the `HEAD` tree: blobs over 5 MiB, build and dependency directories, compiled suffixes | the tree was readable | `pr-large-file`, `pr-generated-artifact` | warning |
| `history-consent` | the owner's reviewed evidence file | the evidence names a state and a reviewer | `pr-consent-withheld` | blocker |

No regular expression stands in for a secret scanner: without a supported one, `secrets` is
`not-measured` (`pr-no-safe-scanner`), never clean. A scanner is refused, not run, when it is
absent (`pr-scanner-absent`), its version cannot be read (`pr-scanner-version-unknown`) or lies
outside the supported range (`pr-scanner-unsupported`). A run that times out, exits with an error or
returns a payload outside the allowlisted schema is `pr-scanner-timeout`, `pr-scanner-failed` or
`pr-scanner-malformed`, and the class stays unmeasured. `reuse` establishes attribution and license
files only; it never establishes dependency compatibility or author consent.

### The evidence file

Dependency-license compatibility and historical author consent are legal facts the owner
establishes. `--evidence <path>` takes a JSON file:

```json
{
  "dependencyLicenses": {"state": "compatible", "reviewedBy": "<who reviewed it>"},
  "historyConsent": {"state": "granted", "reviewedBy": "<who reviewed it>"}
}
```

`dependencyLicenses.state` is `compatible` or `incompatible`; `historyConsent.state` is `granted`
or `withheld`. An absent entry is `pr-evidence-absent`, another state is `pr-evidence-ambiguous`,
an empty reviewer is `pr-evidence-unreviewed` and an unreadable file is `pr-evidence-unreadable` —
each leaves its class `not-measured`. The reviewer's name is checked, never echoed.

## The result

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | every class measured over the declared scope, no finding |
| `1` | every class measured, at least one blocker or warning |
| `2` | at least one class `not-measured`, `partial` or `refused`; measured findings are still returned |

`grantsPublication` is always `false`. A clean exit describes the assessed scope; it is never an
approval to change visibility. A repository with no commit, a path outside git or a path that is
not the repository root refuses every class (`pr-no-commits`, `pr-not-a-repository`,
`pr-not-repository-root`).

## The report

Every finding carries `code`, `class`, `severity`, `remediation`, `owner` and, where it applies, a
`location` and a validated `commit`. Nothing else crosses from a scanner: no snippet, match,
rule text, entropy value, scanner message, personal address or absolute path. A location is a
relative path only when every segment is plain and no run of twenty alphanumerics could be a
value; otherwise it is `opaque:<sha256 prefix>`. At most fifty findings per code are returned;
`truncated` counts the rest.

The command reports blockers, warnings and coverage as three separate tables. An unmeasured class
is named as the reason the assessment is incomplete.

## Disposition

Every `pr-*` code is owner-only. The route and the command never remediate, never rewrite
history, never rotate a credential and never publish. Each row's `remediation` names the owner's
route; the command hands back control and names itself again to reassess once the owner acts.

| Code | Owner remediation |
| --- | --- |
| `pr-secret` | rotate the credential; the owner decides whether to rewrite history |
| `pr-internal-identifier` | review the reference and remove or generalize it |
| `pr-identity-in-metadata` | confirm every author agrees to public commit metadata |
| `pr-large-file`, `pr-generated-artifact` | decide whether the artifact belongs in the published history |
| `pr-attribution-missing`, `pr-license-text-missing` | add the copyright, license information or license texts reuse names |
| `pr-license-incompatible` | resolve the incompatible dependency license |
| `pr-consent-withheld` | obtain consent or remove the contribution |

<!-- rationale -->

Readiness is distinct from align because its failures are not repairable by writing a file: a
secret in history stays public once pushed, and consent is a fact about people. Reporting an
unmeasured category as a gap, rather than as clean, is what keeps a missing scanner from reading as
a green light.
