"""Run Codex as an independent reviewer of a worktree, and prove by code it changed nothing.

The argv is fixed here and nowhere else: `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
--ignore-user-config --ignore-rules` always, so Codex's native sandbox is never asked for (it fails
on hosts without unprivileged user namespaces) and the user's `~/.codex/config.toml` (approval
policy, plugins, hooks) never applies; and never `--ephemeral`, which would erase the quota snapshot
the probe falls back on. The environment loses the same secrets as the executor's. The prompt
arrives on stdin, after the rule that Codex only reads; the events and the last message land in
`.quenching/codex/<run>/`.

The git guard is read before and after: the refs (`HEAD`, branch, reflog, stash, every worktree's
`HEAD`, every ref), the index hash, the ignored local configuration (`.agents/**`, `*.local.json`)
and, for every path `git status` reports, its status and bytes. Any change, or a git command that
fails, is exit 2 `codex-git-guard` naming it: the caller never cleans it and hands the tree to the
human.

    exit 0  Codex finished, wrote the review and changed nothing
    exit 1  Codex failed, wrote nothing or ran past `timeoutSeconds` — the caller falls back
    exit 2  refusal: a missing worktree, prompt or `codex`, a worktree outside git, a run name
            already used; or `codex-git-guard`: the guard saw a change
