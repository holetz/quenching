Codex does **not** require `cq` to be installed in the user's PATH.  A bare `cq` in the
examples below means the shell function defined at the start of the same Bash call; never
assume that `cq` is an independently installed command, and never ask the user to add it to
their shell startup files.

```bash
{CODEX_CQ_WRAPPER}
```

The function uses the plugin-provided root when the host exposes one, otherwise it resolves the
single enabled `quenching-codex` copy through `codex plugin list --json` and its exact cache
version. Multiple enabled installations or a missing selected package are refusals; never choose
the first or newest directory in a cache. It then
executes the bundled `scripts/cq` by absolute path.  Defining it again in each Bash call is
intentional: shell state does not survive between calls, and sub-agents may receive a fresh
environment.

There is no target-repository installation step and no third rung: never look for a copy under a
target's `.agents/hooks/`, never install one there, and never modify the user's PATH to make this
tool resolve.

Branch on the **exit code** (0 ok · 1 findings · 2 refusal) and the `--json` payload, never on
prose.

### Write the resolved path literally on every invocation

The wrapper resolves the installed plugin at the point of execution.  Do not copy a relative path
from this reference into a command: a fresh Bash call has no shared working-directory or shell
state to make a plugin-relative path reliable.  Defining the function again in every Bash call is
the portable form, including for sub-agents.
