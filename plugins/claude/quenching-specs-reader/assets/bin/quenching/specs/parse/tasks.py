# is prose, and must not replace the real `verify:`.
# `constraint:` is INERT by design: the grammar admits it and `next` hands it through, but no
# command reads it. Its only consumer would be an executor sub-agent briefing itself, and the
# decision to dispatch one belongs to another spec — so the field lands first and the decision
# stays untouched. A field nobody reads costs one alternation and moves no turn.
#
# The anchor is written into a one-line grammar and read back, so the only hard requirement
# is that it holds text and stays on its line. `commit:` is both the legacy form of the same
# field — still READ from specs written before the anchor became the subject — AND, since
# `task --commit`, a form written again on purpose: a real git sha, upserted by the CLI once
# the commit that implements the task already exists. `subject:` stays the default `--check`
# writes; `commit:` is opt-in via the new flag. See `task --commit`'s help and `## Design`
