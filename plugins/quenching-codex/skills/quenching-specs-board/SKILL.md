# quenching-specs-board — start the local spec portal

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS` — optional `--read-only` and `--port N`, passed through unchanged.

A launcher. The server, its token and its security rules live in `cq specs serve`; do not restate
them.

## Workflow

### 1. Start the server
Resolve `cq` per [align/tool-resolution.md](../../references/align/tool-resolution.md)
§Resolving the tool; branch on the exit code. Run `cq specs serve --json $ARGUMENTS` with
`run_in_background: true`, then read its first output line.
**Done when:** the first line is the JSON with `url`, or a refusal with its `code` is reported.

### 2. Print the URL
Print the `url` as given, with its token, and whether the portal is read-write or read-only and why.
Say that Ctrl-C or stopping the background task ends it, and that execution stays in Codex
(`quenching-specs-execute <id>`).
**Done when:** the URL and its mode are shown.
