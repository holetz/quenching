# Composing and refining — what `develop` asks, and how

The owner of **what** `quenching-specs-develop` asks and **when it stops**. The command body owns
the loop (resolve → derive the pass → ask → one edit → verify); this file owns the two operations,
the stages around them and the mechanics they share, and the body never restates it.

**Two operations, not a ladder of banks.** **Compose** is monotonic: it takes the spec from wherever
it is to `ready`, filling what is absent. **Refine** is not: it runs over the composed spec and may
rewrite anything it finds, the proposal included. Which of them runs is **derived** — the stage says
where composing starts, the level says whether refining runs without being asked for.

## Contents

`cq components read <this file>` returns the heading index; `--sections` addresses one.

## The pass — what runs, and in what order

A pass runs up to four stages, always in this order:

| # | Stage | Runs when | What it is really asking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | [discoveries](#discoveries) | `## Discoveries` holds a line nobody resolved | what did execution already find that this spec has not absorbed? |
| 1 | [compose](#compose) | the spec is not yet `ready` | what IS this, and what has nobody answered yet? |
| 2 | [refine](#refine) | the level runs it, or a human asked for it | is this the right thing to build at all? |
| 3 | [approval](#approval--the-close-and-its-recommendation) | always | does this spec get a go, and what should happen to it next? |

**The stage says where composing starts, never which operation runs.** `cq specs status --spec <id>
--json` reports it, and the `sections` and `ready` fields of that same payload say exactly which
headings compose still owes:

| Derived stage | What compose has left to do |
| --- | --- |
| `captured` — only `## Problem` is filled | give the problem a shape, then close the ten-section ready set |
| `proposed` · `designed` · `refined` | close whatever of the ready set is still missing or malformed |
| `ready` · `approved` · `executing` | nothing — so the pass is a refine |

**A spec that is already `ready` and gets invoked again is a refine request.** Nothing remains to
compose, and re-invoking the command is a human asking for the one operation left. That is also the
only route by which a `low` spec is ever refined (§Who answers — the gear decides).

**The order is fixed, and it is the whole point.** Arguing with a spec before its tasks, its impact
and its validation exist is arguing with half a claim. *Is this worth building?* is answerable only
against a whole spec, which is why refine runs after compose and never before it.

<!-- rationale -->
The ladder this replaced picked ONE bank per pass off the derived stage and re-derived between them.
Two costs, one cause. Every crossing paid a reference read, a section read, an edit and a `validate`
for a spec nobody had finished. And the crossing was not even honest: the dependency sweep the shape
bank mandates lands `### Mapa de dependências` under `## Design`, and `designed` beats `proposed` by
last-match — so every shape edit derived `designed`, and the adversarial bank, the only one that
ever disagreed with a spec, was skipped by construction. It reached only specs born `proposed`.

What the ladder got right is kept: the pass is derived, never chosen. v2 asked the human to pick
between `interview`, `critic`, `premortem` and `alternatives` before it had read anything — a
question the spec's own state answers better than the human can.

## The four shared mechanics

Every stage of the pass obeys all four.

### 1. Grouped by dependency, and every question carries a recommendation

<!-- rules -->
**A question travels with the ones whose answers cannot change it, and alone otherwise.**

- **Independent → one call.** Where answering A would not change what B asks, ask A and B together
  in a single **AskUserQuestion** — up to the harness cap of **four per call**, each with its own
  options.
- **Dependent → sequential.** Where the next question's *content* depends on the last answer, ask
  it alone, wait, and choose the next in light of what was just said rather than from a list
  written in advance.

Which shape a stage takes is a property of the stage, stated with it:

| Stage | Shape | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [discoveries](#discoveries) | grouped | every line is independent, and all of them take the same fixed set of three resolutions |
| [compose](#compose) | sequential to shape, grouped to close | what is actually wrong decides which shapes are worth tabling at all; once a shape is on the page, the remaining headings do not move one another |
| [refine](#refine) | sequential | a criticism once answered rewrites the next one |

Every question carries **an inline recommendation and the reasoning behind it**, so the human can
answer in one word — in a grouped call, the recommended option is listed **first and marked
"(Recommended)"**:

> **Weak** — "What should the failure budget be?"
> **Strong** — "How many attempts before a task is declared blocked? I'd say five: enough to
> absorb a flaky test or a missing import, short enough that a genuinely wrong approach stops
> burning tokens. Agree, or is this suite slow enough that five is too many?"

Use **AskUserQuestion** when relevant.

<!-- rationale -->
The rule this replaced was *never batch* — absolute, and stronger than its own reason. That reason
was always about **dependence**: a batch of five questions gets one shallow answer covering the
easiest of them, and a single question lets the next be sharper for having heard it. Neither clause
says anything about two questions that cannot reach each other, and paying a full round trip for
each of those buys nothing — every turn re-sends the whole conversation, so a question asked alone
costs the preamble again.

Measured on this repository's own transcripts, question turns are **not** where this command's
tokens go: real `quenching-specs-develop` runs made 2–5 `AskUserQuestion` calls, against whole-file
reference reads worth ~900k token-turns in a single run. Grouping is here because the old rule
overreached, not because it closes a leak.

The recommendation is not a formality. A pass that hands the human a bare question list has moved
the work rather than done it — the command is supposed to arrive with an opinion.

### 2. Accumulate; apply in ONE edit per pass

<!-- rules -->
**Nothing is written while a stage is running.** Keep a running list of
`(question, answer, target section)` and write it all at once, as a single narrated edit. The
accumulation and the one-edit shape are the mechanic; the confirmation that used to gate them is
not. Invoking the command is the authorization, and the human's window on the edit is the spec's own
URL in the backend.

**The edit lands per pass, not per stage** — compose and refine write together, in one call, and the
tool is built for exactly that: `cq specs section <id> "<H1>,<H2>,…" --write` splices N headings and
**lands them as ONE write**, so a mismatched heading set refuses (exit 2) without writing any of
them. A pass is therefore all-or-nothing: an abandoned one leaves the spec exactly as it was.

<!-- rationale -->
- Later answers routinely revise earlier ones, and refine exists to revise what compose just wrote.
  Writing compose's answers before refine has run means editing the same paragraph twice, and the
  intermediate state is never reviewed by anyone.
- One diff is readable. Six scattered edits are not — and that one diff is what the human reads in
  the backend afterwards.
- The gate left when it was priced: this command edits no code and takes no irreversible cycle
  action, so the pair of turns each stage spent waiting protected nothing the backend's own edit
  history does not now carry. What the per-bank boundary used to narrow, the one-edit-per-pass rule
  restores whole.

### 3. A declared stop condition

Each stage below states when it is **done**. Announce the pass's stages and their stop conditions
when the pass starts, so the human knows the shape of what they agreed to, and honour them — a stage
that keeps finding one more question is the free-ranging exploration this front deliberately gave
up.

Three universal stops apply on top of each stage's own:

- **The human calls it.** "That's enough" ends the stage and goes straight to the consolidated edit
  with whatever was accumulated.
- **Diminishing returns.** Two consecutive questions whose answers change nothing about the spec —
  stop and say why.
- **The question is not this spec's.** A question that would read identically against any spec is
  noise. Do not ask it; do not pad the count with it.

### 4. Every answer names the section it lands in

An answer with no destination is conversation, and conversation is what gets summarized away. As
each answer arrives, record which canonical section it belongs to — that mapping IS the
consolidated edit, and an answer that maps to nothing is either out of scope (route it, per the
body's guardrails) or was not worth asking.

## Who answers, and who is argued with — the gear decides

<!-- rules -->

The stages below are the engine of **content**, and each is the same wherever it runs: the same
axes, the same lenses, the same seven gate symptoms, the same stop conditions. **A gear never
shortens a stage.** What the level decides is two things — **who answers** a stage that runs, and
**whether refine runs at all**.

The gear is `priority.complexity`, read from the same `cq specs status --spec <id> --json` payload
that reports the stage
([spec-driven.md](../../references/specs-develop/spec-driven.md) §The scale). Absent reads
as `high`.

| Gear | Who answers compose | Does refine run? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `low` | **the pass**, from evidence, interrupting nobody | **never** — asking for one raises the level first |
| `medium` | **the human**, at every stage of the composition | not on its own; the close **recommends** it where a signal fired |
| `high` | the human, as `medium` | **yes, automatically**, once the composition closes |
| `xhigh` | the human, as `medium` | yes, and §Refine's **premortem lens runs unconditionally** |

**`low` is the only level that does not ask, and that is its whole content.** It answers every item
from what the spec, the codebase, the `/docs/standards/` its `## Impact` declares and
`/docs/glossary.md` support. An answer resting on something unproved is written with **the
assumption named in the text it lands in**. Anything no evidence answers becomes an
`## Open Decisions` line carrying **how it will be decided** — never invented, and never asked. It
composes, it closes, it stamps `approved` `by: low-gear`, and it is done in one pass.

**Every other level asks at every stage of the composition.** It drafts an answer first and puts it
in front of the human as the question — *"here is what I would write for `## Out of Scope`; is the
boundary right?"* — which is what lets independent headings travel grouped under §1: a question
about a **drafted** section cannot change what the next question asks, only what the next edit
writes. Two genuinely dependent questions still travel alone.

**Refine is where the level's second split lives.** `medium` composes and then *recommends*;
`high` and `xhigh` refine on their own authority. Taking the recommendation raises the level, so a
`medium` spec that gets refined is a `high` spec by the time it is — the record and the behaviour
never disagree.

**`low` never refines, and asking is how that is escaped.** A request to refine a `low` spec raises
it to `high` (or `xhigh`, with the premortem) and runs there. A raise re-enters the pass; it never
restarts it — what compose already wrote stays written, and the raise buys the argument the lower
level did not have.

**What the `low` level may never do.** It may not invent an explicit none. It may not resolve a
`## Discoveries` line `promoted:`, which mints a spec (§Discoveries). It may not present a screen
from inside a sub-agent — the sub-agent returns the screen's content and the conductor presents it.
It may not refine. And it may not treat an unanswerable item as answered: `## Open Decisions` with
how it will be decided is the result, and a pass that has no evidence and writes a confident
sentence anyway has failed in the way this level is most likely to fail.

<!-- rationale -->

The line moved, and it moved on purpose. It used to fall between `medium` and `high` — `low` and
`medium` silent, `high` and `xhigh` asking — which made `medium` a second silent level whose only
distinguishing feature was one closing screen. Speed lived in two levels and judgment in two, and
neither pair had a reason to be a pair.

It now falls between `low` and everything else, and a **second** line falls between `medium` and
`high`. That buys each level a fact of its own: `low` is fast, `medium` is attended, `high` is
argued with, `xhigh` is argued with under the worst case. And it puts the speed of small work in one
place, so a spec that should be defined without a conversation asks for it by name instead of
inheriting silence from a level chosen for another reason.

## Compose

**Runs when** the spec is not yet `ready`. **Goal:** take it from wherever it is to a spec worth
building — a shape where there was only a problem, and a closed ten-section ready set where there
were gaps. It is **monotonic**: it fills what is absent and sharpens what is thin; it does not
overturn what a human already settled. Overturning is §Refine's.

**Shape.** Sequential to shape, grouped to close (§1). What is actually wrong decides which shapes
are worth tabling at all; once a shape is on the page, the remaining headings do not move one
another and travel four to a call.

**Drive the gap off the tool, never off a reading of the file.** The `sections` and `ready`
(`{ok, missing, malformed}`) fields of the step's own `cq specs status --spec <id> --json` payload
already name every heading that is absent or malformed, and the section read returns
`(## X is absent)` for the rest — so the map of what compose owes costs no call of its own.

### Giving the problem a shape

Only where `## Proposal` is absent or empty. The dependency sweep runs first (§Gathering the
evidence), and its map lands in `### Mapa de dependências` under `## Design` — written by the
orchestrator, never the sub-agent. Then the problem statement itself, read against the codebase.
Roughly in this order:

- **What is actually wrong.** Is the `## Problem` describing a symptom or a cause? What does the
  code do today — read it, do not theorize.
- **Why now.** What changed, or what does waiting cost? A problem with no answer here is a plan to
  leave in `plans/`, and saying so is a result.
- **The shape.** Two to four genuinely different shapes the answer could take, in a table:
  approach, what it costs, what it buys, what it forecloses. Recommend one.
- **The boundary.** What is the nearest thing someone will mistake for in-scope? That answer is
  `## Out of Scope`, and it is cheapest to write now.
- **What would make this not worth doing.** The honest version of a go/no-go.

A good ASCII diagram — current flow, proposed flow, the state machine — is worth several of these
questions and often replaces one.

**Lands in** `## Proposal` (the shape), `## Out of Scope` (the boundary), `## Design` /
`## Alternatives Considered` when the shapes table produced a real comparison.

**Evidence answers** what is actually wrong (read the code), the shapes table with its
recommendation, and the boundary. **Only a human answers** *why now* — what waiting costs is
appetite, not a fact about the tree — and *what would make this not worth doing*. At `low` both go
to `## Open Decisions` unless `## Problem` already states them.

### Closing the ready set

The rest of the ten sections, honestly. This is the half that most easily degrades into filling
headings to make a check pass, and the explicit-none rule is the whole defence.

The questions come from the gap itself, in the spec's own terms:

- a section that says `- none` with no reason attached — is that a decision or an omission?
- `## Out of Scope` absent → what was ruled out, and what is the nearest in-scope lookalike?
- `## Validation` absent or vague → what exact command proves this worked, and what must it print?
- `## Impact` declaring a standard no task names, or a task writing a doc `## Impact` never
  declared;
- a `## Tasks` item whose completion nobody could judge ("improve error handling");
- a task ordering that has step 4 depending on step 7;
- a term the spec uses in a sense the repo's glossary does not.

**And the three questions only this moment can answer** — every one of them is a decision
`quenching-specs-execute` is forbidden to make for itself, so a spec that leaves them unasked is
built with the cheap options closed:

- **which task groups touch provably disjoint `files:`** → mark them `[P]` now. Execution **never
  infers** the marker ([spec-driven.md](spec-driven.md) §`## Tasks` and the `[!]` blocked marker),
  so an unmarked group runs serially forever, however disjoint it was.
- **which delegable task is missing `files:`** → declaring it is what *permits* the task to be
  handed to an executor sub-agent at all; omitting it forecloses both delegation and `[P]`.
- **which task has an obvious existing file to imitate** → `pattern:`, the cheapest context an
  executor can be given: one path beats three paragraphs of description.

Measured across five `ready` specs on this repository — 48 tasks — `files:` was declared on 81% and
`verify:` on 92%, but `pattern:` on 8% and `[P]` on **4%**, with three of the five specs carrying no
parallel-eligible task at all. The mechanism was never the missing piece; the question was.

Compose also settles the two declarations nothing else owns: the **`verification` policy** (one of
the three values in [spec-driven.md](spec-driven.md) §Frontmatter, asked once and written to
frontmatter, so `execute` never has to guess mid-build) and the parsed `### Standards this spec will
write into docs/standards/` sub-heading under `## Impact`.

**Evidence answers** all seven symptoms and all three execution decisions — `[P]`, `files:`
and `pattern:` are provable against the tree, and `cq specs parallel` proves the first
mechanically. **Only a human answers** the `verification` policy; at `low` the pass **declares
nothing** and lets the default stand, because stamping the default records a decision nobody made.

**Stop when** the ready set is closed — every gate section answered with content or a reasoned
`- none`, every task with a judgeable completion, no `## Impact` path uncovered — and the human
would recognise the spec as describing their idea. A `[P]` compose set is **proved** when the edit
lands, by `cq specs parallel`, never argued about here: the tool checks disjunction mechanically and
names the group it refuses.

<!-- rationale -->
These were two banks, `shape` and `gate`, separated by an edit and a re-derivation. They were never
two questions: closing the ready set is finishing what shaping started, over sections the same pass
is writing. The split bought one thing — a stage transition on disk — and cost a full crossing to
buy it, while the `## Design` that transition depended on was being written by the dependency sweep
as a side effect. One operation, one edit, one `validate`.

## Refine

**Runs when** the level runs it — `high` and `xhigh`, automatically, once the composition closes —
or when a human asks for it, which is the only route at `low` and `medium` (§Who answers). **Goal:**
make the spec survive the argument, or change it.

**This is the one operation with a licence to overturn.** Compose fills; refine may rewrite anything
it finds — cut the scope, convert a risk, re-table the alternatives, and **change the proposal
itself**. That licence is safe because of where refine runs: at `medium` and above the human answers
at every stage, so a changed proposal is a question put to a person, never a decision a pass took
alone. `low` never refines, which is why the licence never reaches an unattended pass.

**Shape.** Sequential (§1) — a criticism once answered rewrites the next one.

**It runs over a composed spec.** The tasks, the impact, the validation and the risks exist by the
time it starts, which is what makes *is this the right thing to build at all?* answerable rather
than rhetorical.

**The dependency sweep, where compose did not run it.** A spec that reached refine without ever
being swept — invoked again when it was already `ready` — gets the sweep first, on the same terms
(§Gathering the evidence). Its result lands in the same `### Mapa de dependências` under
`## Design`, written by the orchestrator. A spec is swept at most once.

It runs three lenses. Use the ones the spec's own signals argue for; a spec that deserves two gets
two, in this order. **At `xhigh` the premortem runs regardless of what the signals say** — that lens
is the judgment the level buys, and a level whose stage fires only on a trigger it shares with every
other level buys nothing.

### The signals — which lenses fire, and what the close recommends

The same three conditions do double duty: they select the lenses here, and they are what
§Approval's closing screen judges the composition against when it recommends the next move.

| Signal | Lens it fires |
| --- | --- |
| `## Alternatives Considered` is absent, empty, or records one option | alternatives |
| the spec is large, reaches into product code, or `## Impact` declares an uncovered standard | critique |
| the spec is risky or irreversible: a migration, a rename with a blast radius, a release | premortem |

**No signal fired** is a result, not a gap: the close recommends approving, and says so. Reading the
signals costs nothing beyond the sections the pass already has.

### Lens: alternatives

Generate **two to four genuinely different** approaches — different in shape, not in parameter.
"Same design with a bigger cache" is not an alternative. Include, where they apply, the three that
are almost always available and almost never written down: **do nothing** (what happens if this is
not built?), **the smallest thing that could work**, and **buy or borrow instead of build**.

Table them — approach, cost, benefit, what it forecloses — state a recommendation with the
reasoning, and ask the one question: does the spec keep its approach, or switch?

Each alternative is stated as its strongest advocate would state it; one that cannot be written
down convincingly was not a real alternative and does not belong in the table.

Lands in `## Alternatives Considered` — **including the rejected ones and why they lost**, which is
the entire point: the next person to have the same idea reads why it was already turned down. A
switch also rewrites `## Proposal`, and every section the old proposal reached.

### Lens: critique

Assume the spec is wrong and find where. Be specific. Aim at:

- **The premise.** Does `## Problem` describe a problem anyone actually has? What is the evidence?
- **Scope inflation.** Which part of `## Proposal` does not follow from `## Problem`? What survives
  if it is cut?
- **Cheaper paths.** What buys 80% of the benefit for 20% of the change?
- **Contradiction with a binding contract.** Does any task violate a `docs/standards/` doc? Name
  the doc and the line.
- **Permanent cost.** What does this add forever — surface, config, a rule to remember? Is the
  benefit recurring or one-off?
- **Reversibility.** If this turns out wrong in a month, what does undoing it cost?
- **The load-bearing assumption.** Which single unstated assumption, if false, invalidates the spec?

**Every criticism carries a proposed remedy**: cut it, defer it, shrink it, or accept it with a
stated reason.

Lands in `## Out of Scope` (a scope cut taken), `## Open Decisions` (one that needs evidence), or
the spec's own sections where the remedy rewrites them.

### Lens: premortem — unconditional at `xhigh`

State the frame out loud: *"It is three months from now. This spec was built and it went badly.
What happened?"* — then generate the failure stories from the spec's actual content, not from a
generic risk list.

Cover at least: what broke for a user of this repo; what half-landed and left an inconsistent
state; what the spec assumed about existing code that was not true; what the tasks did not cover;
who could not use the result. For each story: how likely, how bad, and **how it is detected** — a
failure nobody notices is worse than a loud one.

Then convert. Every story becomes exactly one of: a **mitigation task** in `## Tasks`; a **risk
with a named mitigation** in `## Risks`; an **accepted risk**, recorded with the reason it is
acceptable; or a **scope cut** into `## Out of Scope`. A story that converts into nothing was not a
real risk — drop it and say so.

**Evidence answers** every alternative in the table, all seven critique targets and every
premortem story — each is readable against the tree. **Only a human answers** the accept-versus-cut
verdict where the remedy trades scope for risk, and **every proposal change**, which is the one
thing this operation may propose and never take alone.

**A refine that rewrites what compose wrote in the same pass rewrites the draft, not the file.**
Both land in the pass's single edit, so the spec never holds the superseded version.

**Stop when** every criticism has been answered, every failure story converted, the alternatives
table exists and the human has chosen — and the spec's biggest remaining risk is one they
explicitly accepted.

## Discoveries

**Runs when** `## Discoveries` holds a line with no resolution on it — stage 0 of the pass, before
compose, at any derived stage.

**Goal.** Empty the queue an executor filled indiscriminately. Whether a discovery is worth acting
on is this stage's judgment, never the executor's — which is exactly why it was captured without
one.

**Shape.** Grouped (§1) — the lines do not reach each other, and every one of them takes the same
three resolutions, so four fit in one call.

Ask about the unresolved lines, four to a call, each with a recommendation. Every line resolves **in
place**, so provenance is never lost:

```markdown
- the rate limiter double-counts retries -> promoted: fix-retry-accounting
- the config loader is slow on cold start -> dismissed: acceptable, runs once
```

Three resolutions and nothing else:

| Resolution | When | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `promoted: <id>` | it is work someone will do, and the front does not already hold it | one `cq specs list --json` to check, then one `cq specs new` — offer it, and write the ID back |
| `folded: <section>` | it changes THIS spec | the answer lands in that section in the same edit |
| `dismissed: <reason>` | it is real but not worth acting on, or another spec already covers it | one line, and the reason is the whole value |

**Check the front before minting.** `promoted:` reads the open specs first; where one already
covers the line, resolve it `dismissed: already covered by {id}`.

A line is never deleted, and never left unresolved with a shrug. `dismissed: acceptable` with no
reason is the failure mode to hunt for.

At `low`, `folded:` and `dismissed:` are resolutions evidence supports. **`promoted:` is not** — it
mints a spec, which no unattended pass may do. The line stays unresolved, this stage's stop
condition is **not met**, and the report says so. A `dismissed:` invented to empty the queue is the
failure mode to hunt for here.

**Stop when** every line carries a resolution.

<!-- rationale -->
A queue filled by executors that could not see each other produces the same finding several times,
so the duplicate arrives through the front door and has to be turned away there.

## Approval — the close, and its recommendation

**Runs** always, last. **Goal.** Settle the one fact the sections cannot — **that this spec may be
built** — and say what should happen to it next.

This stage adds nothing to the body: it writes one record and no section. What it shows is always
the same: what the spec now commits to, in the proposal's one line, the task count, the
`verification` policy in force, the declared `docs/standards/` paths, and the biggest accepted
risk.

**The screen recommends, rather than defaulting to approve.** It judges what the pass just produced
against §Refine's three signals and leads with the move those signals argue for, marked
"(Recommended)" and carrying the signal that motivated it in its own text:

| Recommendation | When | What choosing it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Approve** | no signal fired | `cq specs record "<id>" approved --set date=<today> --set by=human`, never by editing the provider document directly |
| **Refine** | a scope or critique signal fired, and refine has not run this pass | a **raise to `high`** because the composition has outgrown its original level; the choice IS the OK to restamp `complexity`, and the pass re-enters at refine |
| **Refine with the premortem** | the spec is irreversible | a raise to `xhigh`, same mechanics, premortem forced |
| **Stop here** | — | nothing stamped, and the report says what is open |

A pass where refine already ran does not recommend refining again; it recommends approving, and
names what the argument settled. Recommending the raise a human has already taken is asking them to
decide the same thing twice.

**At `low` — the pass approves, and the record says so.**
`cq specs record "<id>" approved --set date=<today> --set by=low-gear`. There is no screen, because
`low` is the level whose whole content is that there is none. The review window is **the spec's URL
in the backend**, announced before the pass read anything and repeated in its report. The stamp is
not an inference from the sections and never claims to be one: `by:` is what keeps a level's
authority distinguishable from a human's word, and a reader who wants only human approvals filters
on it.

**The gate is a floor, not a verdict.** `ready` means ten sections have content; it does not mean
the spec is good — which is what refine is for. And approval is not a gate either: `execute` on an
unapproved spec asks inline and stamps rather than refusing, so declining here costs nothing but a
question later.

**Stop when** the record carries both a `date` and a `by`, or the human stopped the pass.

## Gathering the evidence — economically, and delegated

<!-- rules -->

Every stage that reads the codebase or `docs/` to answer its own questions — compose's
"read it, do not theorize" included, not only what follows below — does so under
[align/evidence-doctrine.md](../../references/align/evidence-doctrine.md):
the aggregate a `grep`/`gh`/`cq` call produces, never the raw dump; `cq components read <path>
--sections "§X"` for `docs/standards/` and `knowledge/glossary.md`, the same way this
plugin's own references already address a section instead of a whole file.

Two uses delegate that reading to a sub-agent, and they do not share one tool profile.

**The dependency sweep** runs **once per spec, at the pass's open** — before compose asks anything,
and before refine does where compose did not run. It is the only mandatory reading of the two: a
cross-file dependency map gathered before anything is asked, never in place of asking. It is asked
for **one table** — every file the proposal's own area touches or is touched by, and what breaks or
goes orphaned if it changes — which lands **dated** in `### Mapa de dependências` under `## Design`.
A spec is swept **at most once**, and never for having crossed a `complexity` level: a spec looks
small exactly while nobody has read its dependencies. Its sub-agent runs the **wider** profile —
read-only in full, everything but `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit` and `Agent`, `Bash` included —
because a dependency map is exactly the aggregate a `grep`/`gh`/`cq` call produces, and the narrower
profile below could not return it.

**Compose and refine** additionally ask questions that only a reading answers: which alternatives
the codebase actually admits, which `docs/standards/` contract a task would violate, which term
the spec uses in a sense the glossary does not. That reading is **optional and delegable**; the
interrogation never is.

Where it is taken, the sub-agent runs the **narrower** profile — `Read, Grep, Glob` and nothing
else — and returns **one compact table** and no trail:

| Stage | What it is asked for |
| --- | --- |
| refine | candidate whole-shape alternatives, each with cost, benefit and what it forecloses |
| refine | contradictions with a binding contract — the `docs/standards/` doc and the line |
| compose | terms the spec uses in a sense `glossary.md` does not |
| compose | `## Impact` paths no `## Tasks` item names, and tasks naming paths `## Impact` never declared |

All three sub-agents follow the verifier shape: they **inspect and report, never edit**. The
narrower two state an explicit *not checked here* list, which is the false-positive control; the
dependency sweep returns a table with no verdict to hedge, so it carries none.

**The orchestrator keeps every question, every write and every confirmation.** The sub-agent never
talks to the human and never touches the spec — the dependency map included, which the
orchestrator writes into `### Mapa de dependências` under `## Design`, never the sub-agent. Every
sub-agent's findings are material for questions the orchestrator still asks itself, under §1 —
never answers substituted for them.

<!-- rationale -->

Two things that look like this and are not available. **`context: fork` cannot ask a question** —
`sk-fork-gate` is an error, and a fork beside an `AskUserQuestion` grant is incoherent by
construction ([capabilities.md](../../references/components-command-new/capabilities.md)
§`context: fork`); every level but `low` is nothing but questions. And a sub-agent **does not share
the session's prompt cache** — it runs on a cold context and pays the full first read of every file
it touches, so delegation here is never a cache play.

What it *is* is the delegation test met exactly: the returned table is far smaller than the sweep
that produced it, and the sweep's file reads stay out of the long context that the interrogation
then pays for on **every** turn that follows.

Why the dependency sweep exists at all, and the measurement that would graduate it, are recorded in
`/docs/standards/automation/dependency-sweep.md` — this plugin's own bundle, not a target's.
Named bare because the rules above stand without it; every binding half is here.

## Recording the pass

`refined: {mode, date}` records that a real interrogation happened and which operation ran it. Stamp
it **only** for the two stages that interrogate:

| Stage | Stamps `refined`? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| discoveries | no | it resolves a queue; it does not interrogate the spec |
| compose | `mode: compose` | every gap was questioned rather than filled in silently |
| refine | `mode: refine` | the spec was argued with, and could have lost |
| approval | no | it authorizes; `approved` is its own record |

A pass that ran both stamping stages records the **deepest** one reached — `refine` over `compose` —
because that is the strongest claim the pass supports. The record is `writeOnce: false`
([spec-driven.md](spec-driven.md) §Frontmatter): a later pass restamps it, because a second
interrogation is a new fact, not a correction of the old one. `mode: refine` is the one value that
cannot be earned by completeness, which is what makes it worth reading.

**Never fabricate it.** `refined` is written only after a stage really ran. It is the one field
whose entire value is that it cannot be inferred from the sections, so a stamp on a pass where
nothing ran makes the field worthless everywhere.

**`low` still stamps it.** At `low` compose answers its own questions from evidence, and **that
drafting IS the interrogation** — the record says which operation ran it, never who answered. What
the record can never survive is a pass that ran nothing and stamped anyway. `mode: refine` is
unreachable at `low` by construction, since `low` never refines.

**`approved` carries a second field, and it is never omitted.** `by: human` for a person's word on
the closing screen, `by: low-gear` for the stamp a `low` pass makes on the level's authority
(§Approval). A record written with no `by:` reads as `human` — that is the only thing that could
have written it before the field existed — so leaving it off a `low-gear` stamp silently claims a
human the pass never had. The tool cannot require a field on a record; this rule is what does.
