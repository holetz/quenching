"""`cq git audit` — the facts the `verifier` agent checks inside a spec's worktree, read with a
fixed argv so the agent needs no `Bash(git …)` grant at all.

A wildcard grant such as `Bash(git -C * status:*)` admits any git command that merely ends in
`status` — `branch -D`, `clean -fdx`, `-c core.fsmonitor=<cmd>` — and `git log:*` admits
`--output=<file>`. Here the agent names a worktree and refs; every git invocation is built in this
module, refs are resolved to commits before use, and the repository's own config cannot run a
command during the read: the `filter.<x>` drivers it declares are blanked before `status` through
`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`, which carries a key containing `=` that `-c key=value` would split, and `status`
does not descend into submodules (their own config is not ours to blank); every diff and show
read carries `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv`, so neither `diff.external` nor a `diff.<x>.textconv`
driver runs; `log.showSignature` is forced off so `gpg.program` never runs; and a partial clone's lazy fetch is off
(`GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH`, and `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` empty refuses every transport), so a missing blob
or an absent `--sha` never runs `core.sshCommand` or any other transport the config names.
`rewrites` and `reflog` are evidence of what the worker did not erase, not proof against a worker with
`Bash`: `git reflog delete` or `expire` removes the entries and the payload then reads empty with
`complete: true`. The audit, like check 9 of the verifier, catches the widening a worker that follows the
protocol makes by mistake; it is not a sandbox against one who evades it on purpose (a worker with
free `Bash` writes outside any diff anyway). A REPORT only, exit 0 on any facts, and a read that failed is
an entry of the payload's `errors` (`complete: false`), never an empty list; judging them is the verifier's.
An agent, command or skill is read under `.agents/`, under `plugins/<one segment>/`, and under every
plugin root the base or the tip declares (a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, a relative `source` of a
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and the component paths either names), never by an `agents/` at
any depth, so an OKF standard filed under `standards/agents/` is no grant. A file a CI root of the
base or the tip includes (GitLab `include`, top level or under a job's `trigger:`, Azure `template:`,
`@self` included, GitHub `uses: ./`, where `./` is the whole repository), transitively, is
surface like the root itself. `generated` is the part of `changed` that is a byte-for-byte copy of its
source file under a module the BASE's `plugins/quenching/assets/modules.json` declares (same relative
path, same blob at the tip, or absent from both); derived outputs that are no copy are never in it.
Nothing here executes the
audited branch's code: the gate is certified by CI before the merge, never by this verb."""
