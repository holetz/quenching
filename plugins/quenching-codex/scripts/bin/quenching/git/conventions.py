"""`cq git conventions` — the one read every command in the `git` pillar runs once before its
first commit, over BOTH layers a target may declare: the directives it addressed to the plugin in
`.agents/quenching.json`'s `gitConventions`, and the standard it published under
`docs/standards/git/**`. `assets/references/git/conventions.md` §The declared-directive layer and
§The read-if-present rule are the contract; this is their one mechanical reading, so five commands
stop repeating the same `ls`, frontmatter peek and config load.

Reports FACTS ONLY — which directives are declared, which files exist, and each file's own
`authority`. Whether a partial document covers commits but not merges is a reading a human (or the
citing command body) does over what comes back; this stays a report for the same reason the rest of
the `git` pillar carries no `doctor`.

`governs` and `declared` answer the DOCS layer and nothing else, unchanged. A single word over
three layers would have to lie in the ordinary case — the config names two artifacts and the
target's own doc covers the rest — so the config arrives as its own two fields instead."""
