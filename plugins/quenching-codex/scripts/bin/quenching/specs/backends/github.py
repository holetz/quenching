class GitHubBackend(SpecBackend):
    """Specs as GitHub issues, reached through `gh api` in a subprocess.

    ONE ISSUE IS ONE SPEC, and the phase is the issue's own state: open is `plans`, closed
    is `archive`. That mapping is not a shortcut — it is the same fact told once. A label
    would be a second declaration of a phase the tracker already knows, and the two would
    diverge the first time somebody closed an issue from the web UI.

    ONE ISSUE BODY IS THE WHOLE DOCUMENT. There are no sub-issues: the retirement and what
    measured it are recorded at HYBRID SERIALISATION above. A document past GitHub's body
    ceiling spills into continuation comments on its own issue, which is the only reason this
    class ever makes a second call for one spec.

    It derives NOTHING. `resolve_one` picks the spec, `derive_info` produces the stages,
    gates, records and tasks, exactly as they are produced for a file on disk; `parse_tasks`
    is the ONLY thing that ever decides a task is checked or blocked. This class turns issues
    into the canonical document and back and does no more than that.

    THE SEVEN FRONTMATTER RECORDS STAY IN THE BODY, none of them a label — every FIELD a
    record carries, that is. Multi-field records (`priority`, `branch`, `merge`, `refined`)
    have no honest single-string label form — encoding `{level, criticality, complexity,
    date}` into a label name would invent a second format only a new parser could read
    back, which is the backend deriving its own encoding exactly where the interface
    forbids it. Keeping them in the body costs the records being invisible in the issue
    list without opening the issue — that gap is what the `spec:` labels below close.

    A `spec:` LABEL PER PRESENT RECORD, PLUS `spec:built` FOR THE DERIVED `executing`
    STAGE, rides inside the same PATCH `_store` already makes — never a second call, never
    read back. This is rendering derived state onto the tracker's own UI, not a second
    encoding of a record's fields: `derive_labels` computes the desired set from `info`
    alone, and `reconcile_label_set` folds it against whatever the issue already carries so
    a human's own label (never under the `spec:` prefix) is untouched. See
    /docs/standards/architecture/spec-backend.md for the category this is, and why it is not
    the sub-issue projection that was retired.

    The listing is fetched once per process and cached, which is a local cache and NOT a
    store: it is not authoritative, nothing outside this object reads it, and every write
    drops it. It exists because the CLI asks for the listing more than once per command,
    and each ask is a network round trip. Since the listing already carries every body,
    `read_spec` costs NOTHING beyond it for a one-part spec — which is every spec but the
    largest two this repository holds."""
