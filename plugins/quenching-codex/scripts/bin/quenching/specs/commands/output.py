    ONE HELPER FOR TEN EMIT SITES, because the field was wrong at all ten in the same way and
    a fix applied ten times is a fix nine of which can rot. External backends have no local
    document root, so `root` is always `null` and the backend name says which remote owns the
    canonical document.

    THE KEY IS NOT RENAMED. `root` stays `root`: the swept consumers read it as a locator to
    show, never to compose a path from, so correcting the value is additive while renaming the
    key would break every installed target for nothing.

    `null` rather than the empty string, and rather than the declared path: an empty string
    makes every consumer invent its own vacuity test, and the declared path is the lie itself.
