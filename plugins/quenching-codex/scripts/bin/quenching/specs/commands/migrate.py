"""`migrate --to git` — move the specs of a tracker backend onto the `quenching` branch.
(`--to azure` and `--to github` are the other direction, below: the git store onto a tracker.)

Dry run unless `--write`. The whole front is read from the configured tracker backend (every
continuation part included, because `read_spec` reassembles the document), written under the
SAME IDs in ONE commit — open specs in `specs/`, closed ones in `specs/archive/` — and the
specs-axis configuration is copied into the branch's `quenching.json`. The command prints the
change the human applies to `.claude/quenching.json`; it never edits that file.

The check that makes the move trustworthy is an equality, not a promise: after the commit the
`git` store's listing must equal the source's modulo locator, and every difference is reported.
Closed tracker items are never touched (the history stays where it is); `--thin-open-cards`
rewrites only the OPEN ones to the thin card, after the commit has landed.
