"""The section rule over FREE markdown — every heading, the body it owns, and the rule half.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor components script.

`cq specs section` reads a SPEC, whose fourteen headings are a validated contract. A reference or
a standard is free markdown, so the two cannot share an implementation — but they must not
disagree about what a section IS. Per `/.knowledge/standards/code/canonical-set-parsing.md`, what is
shared is the RULE, proved by both tools against the same canonical case list.
