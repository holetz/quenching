# /quenching:ops:status — read the operations front

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS` (an optional target repository root; omit to use the current repository).

This command is the read-only view of the operations front. It reports the configuration, router,
entry points by package, lifecycle states, findings by code and disposition band, and registry
freshness. It never repairs a finding, writes a registry, or turns an absent optional artifact into
a healthy one.

The payload and target tree are defined by
[ops-align/target-structure.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/ops-align/target-structure.md),
[ops-align/lifecycle.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/ops-align/lifecycle.md), and
[ops-align/bands.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/ops-align/bands.md). Resolve `cq` per
[tool-resolution.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/align/tool-resolution.md)
§Resolving the tool. Use the resolved path literally and branch on exit code and JSON:
`0` is a clean report, `1` carries findings, and `2` is a refusal.

## Workflow

### 1. Read the status payload

Set `TARGET_ROOT` to the supplied argument, or to `.` when the argument is omitted, and run:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/bin/cq" --root "$TARGET_ROOT" ops status --json
```

On exit `2`, report the refusal and every missing configuration key exactly as returned. Do not
guess an operations root, router, registry, or optional file. On exit `0` or `1`, use the payload
as the complete read model; do not invoke a write-capable subcommand.

**Done when:** the status payload is captured, or a configuration refusal has been reported, and
nothing has been written.

### 2. Classify and report the front

Report one compact table:

| Band | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Configuration | declared operations root, configuration refusal state, and target root |
| Router | declared path, kind, existence, and `health`; missing is missing, never healthy |
| Surface | scanned count and entry points grouped by package |
| Lifecycle | active, archived, and undeclared counts |
| Mechanical | `op-undocumented` and `op-registry-stale` counts, with registry freshness state |
| Structural | `op-adhoc-root`, `op-untyped-exit`, and `op-no-router` counts |
| Judgement | `op-unarmed-write`, `op-disabled-check`, and `op-orphan` counts, reported only |

Map findings to their bands through `bands.md`, preserve every finding code, and distinguish
errors from warnings using the payload's `errors` and `warnings`. A missing or stale registry is
reported with its emitted code; never create it or call it healthy because no rows were found.

**Done when:** every returned field has an authoritative row or an explicit missing/refused state,
and every finding keeps its code and disposition.

### 3. Hand back control

State that this command wrote nothing. For an actionable mechanical or structural finding, name
`/quenching:ops:align` as the command that can converge it. For a judgement finding, retain its
evidence and name the target owner's closing command from `bands.md`; status never runs it.

**Done when:** the report ends with the appropriate owner for each finding and no repair has been
attempted.

## Invariants

- Read only: no registry generation, entry-point edit, router selection, or lifecycle move.
- A configuration refusal, missing router, and missing registry remain explicit states.
- Finding codes and their three disposition bands come from `bands.md`; none are invented or
  softened.
- The report distinguishes errors, warnings, and clean capability notes.
