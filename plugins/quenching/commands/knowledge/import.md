# /quenching:knowledge:import — import an external source into the OKF bundle

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS` (the source to ingest — local file/folder paths, or URLs).

A Claude-native analogue of the OKF reference implementation's `enrich` command — **without**
BigQuery or heavy dependencies. It reads an external source (local files/folders, or URLs)
and mints **multiple** conformant OKF concept docs from it. It is a **batch fan-out of
`/quenching:knowledge:add`**: [`knowledge-add/homes.md`](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/knowledge-add/homes.md)
is the **single owner** of the per-doc procedure (classify → stamp → index → glossary →
self-check); this skill **cites** it and adds only the ingestion-safety deltas below. Source
scoping, the bounded-crawl rules, unit extraction, dedup, and attribution are in
[knowledge-import/sources.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/knowledge-import/sources.md). Requires an existing OKF bundle — run
`/quenching:knowledge:align` first if `/.knowledge/` is not one.

## Doctrine (own deltas; the per-doc procedure is homes.md)

- **Cite, don't restate.** Every per-doc step — home + `type` + mold classification, the
  frontmatter stamp, updating `index.md`, enriching the glossary, self-check — lives in
  homes.md. This skill restates none of it; it adds only these deltas.
- **Bounded ingestion (discipline, not code).** A web source is bounded **up front**: an
  explicit **seed list**, a **page cap**, and a **host allowlist** — never an open crawl. Fetch only what the user named, plus links **within the
  allowed hosts** up to the cap; report everything you did **not** fetch.
- **Anti-fabrication.** Mint only what the source actually supports. A rule not proven in the
  **target's own** code enters as `authority: background` (a proposal), never
  `authority: current`. Never invent a `resource:` — derive it from the source (a glob set of
  what the doc governs, or the URL) — and never invent a `source_uri:` either: it is the unit's
  real URI, or it is absent. How each doc records where it came from is sources.md's to state,
  cited at the top of this file and deliberately not repeated here.
- **MERGE, never clobber.** A unit that maps to an existing doc/term is an **enrich** target —
  fill missing keys, sharpen the body — never overwrite a filled field or a filled body.
- **Never ingest transient / secret / PII.** Skip credentials, tokens, personal data, and
  ephemeral chatter — they are not durable knowledge. A secret is **referenced, never copied**.
- **Additive only.** Enrich never deletes a source or a bundle doc; it mints and merges.

## Workflow (force-with-1-confirmation, like `/quenching:knowledge:align`)

### 1. Scope the source (read-only)
Identify the inputs: local files/folders (`Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`) or URLs (`WebFetch`). For a
web source, fix the **seed list**, **page cap**, and **host allowlist** *before* fetching
anything, and fetch nothing outside them ([knowledge-import/sources.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/knowledge-import/sources.md)).
Read the source; write nothing yet. **Done when:** the bounded input set and web policy are fixed.

### 2. Extract → classify → dedup
Break the source into **knowledge units** (one concept each). Classify every unit into
home + `type` + mold via homes.md §Classification.

Then **dedup** exactly as [sources.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/knowledge-import/sources.md)
§Dedup fixes it — within the source, then against the bundle, and against the bundle **by exact
`source_uri` before resemblance**. What this step owes step 3 is the verdict that ordering
produces: every unit leaves here labelled **new**, **already imported** (an exact URI hit — the
doc it hit is the MERGE target), or **resembles an existing doc** (a judgement, not a match),
carrying the URI or the term that decided it. For a large source, fan **one `Task` sub-agent per source
slice** out to return **compact unit candidates** (home / `type` / path / one-line + source
anchor + its `source_uri`), never full bodies; the orchestrator merges and judges. Extraction sub-agents may run
on a **cheap model/effort** — enrich **deletes nothing**, so a misclassification only misfiles
a doc (correctable), unlike `/quenching:knowledge:import-memory` (see the model policy in
  [README.md §cost-model](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/README.md#cost-model)). **Done when:** every unit
  has a new/imported/resemblance verdict with its source anchor.

### 3. Present ONE ingestion plan → gate on ONE OK
Show the **complete** plan: every doc to **mint** or **enrich** with its home, `type`, path,
one-line summary, and source anchor; and, for a web source, the seed/cap/allowlist and what was
left unfetched.

Every row also carries **why** it is a mint or enrich — the step-2 verdict, with the
evidence under it: **new** (no URI hit and nothing resembling it); **already imported**, showing
the matching `source_uri:` and the doc it hit; or **resembles an existing doc**, showing the
title, slug or term that matched and the doc it matched. The last is the only one the human is
really being asked to check — an exact URI match needs no trust and a resemblance does, and
rendering the two identically is how a wrong MERGE hides inside a batch OK.

A single OK executes the whole batch. A
minted/edited doc whose change reaches the target's **product code** is its **own**
confirmation item (mirrors `/quenching:knowledge:align`) — never folded into the batch OK.
**Done when:** the complete mint/enrich table and every separate code-coupled item are presented.

### 4. Execute on OK — mint each doc via the insert procedure
For each planned unit, run homes.md: fill the mold (§The frontmatter stamp;
`authority: background` for an unproven standard), write the doc (cross-home links absolute,
within-home relative), update the folder's `index.md` (§Updating `index.md`), and enrich the
glossary if it introduced a repo-specific term (§Enriching the glossary). Fan **one `Task`
executor per slice** out for scale — the executors write docs; the **orchestrator alone** keeps
each `index.md` honest and resolves cross-slice dedup.

Stamp `source_uri:` on every doc this run **creates** — the unit's exact URI, the one key
homes.md's mold deliberately leaves out — and, when the source is a stable URL, write the body
line naming it **with the date it was read**, exactly as
[sources.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/knowledge-import/sources.md) specifies. A doc
being **enriched** already carries the `source_uri:` that found it; MERGE never rewrites it.
**Done when:** every approved unit is written, indexed, and glossary-checked or its failure is
reported.

### 5. Self-check + validate
Self-check every touched file against homes.md §Self-check /
[knowledge-align/conformance.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/knowledge-align/conformance.md),
then run `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/bin/cq" knowledge validate /.knowledge` over the
bundle: **zero errors**, and the structural WARNs (`dir-no-index` / `index-broken-link` /
`index-orphan`) cleared. Report residue — units deferred, sources left unfetched, MERGE
targets skipped. **Done when:** validation has run and deferred work is named.

## Invariants to never violate
- **Never add `context: fork`.** This is a sweep skill: it gates on a mid-flow plan → OK,
  which a forked context cannot present (the [CLAUDE.md](../../../../CLAUDE.md) rule).
- Never mint beyond what the source supports; an unproven rule is `authority: background`,
  never `current`; never invent a `resource:`.
- Never overwrite a filled field or body — MERGE.
- Never ingest a secret/token/PII or transient chatter; **reference** a secret, never copy it.
- Never crawl unbounded — seed list + page cap + host allowlist, always; report what you
  skipped.
- Never delete a source or a bundle doc — enrich is mint-and-merge only.
