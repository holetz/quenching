  Fetch a pull request's unresolved review threads, address each on the human's own confirmation, and
  mark it resolved once the fix is committed, on GitHub or Azure DevOps. Use when the user asks to
  "resolve PR comments", "address the review feedback", "fix what the reviewer flagged", or "work
  through the open review threads". Not for: opening a PR → /quenching:git:pr:create; merging it →
  /quenching:git:merge.

# /quenching:git:pr:review — work through a PR's unresolved threads

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS` — a provider PR number/id. Omitted → the active PR open for the current
branch.

Reads **unresolved review threads** specifically — not every comment, and not ones already marked
resolved.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the provider, PR and repository
```bash
# Read `backend` from this result before choosing a host CLI.
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/bin/cq specs config --json
git remote get-url origin
# github
gh repo view --json owner,name -q '.owner.login + " " + .name'
gh pr view <$ARGUMENTS, or the current branch's PR> --json number -q .number
# azure-boards
az repos pr list --status all --top 1 --detect true --output json
az repos pr show --id <id> --detect true --output json
az repos pr list --source-branch "$(git branch --show-current)" --status active \
  --detect true --output json
```
Run only the probe for the configured provider, after confirming the origin host matches it. On
Azure, an explicit argument goes to `show`; with no argument, `list` is filtered to the current
branch. No PR resolves for the current branch and none was given → say so and stop. More than one
active Azure PR → show the ids and ask which one to work. **Done when:** the provider, repository
and PR number/id are known.

### 2. Fetch every unresolved thread
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner:String!,$repo:String!,$n:Int!,$after:String){
    repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo){
      pullRequest(number:$n){
        reviewThreads(first:100, after:$after){
          pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor}
          nodes{ id isResolved path line
            comments(first:10){ pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor} nodes{ body author{login} } } } } } }' \
  -F owner=<owner> -F repo=<repo> -F n=<number> -F after=null
# azure-boards — use the repository/project ids from `az repos pr show`.
az devops invoke --area git --resource pullRequestThreads \
  --route-parameters project=<project-id> repositoryId=<repository-id> pullRequestId=<pr-id> \
  --api-version 7.1 --output json
```
For GitHub filter to `isResolved: false`; if `hasNextPage` is true, paginate until it is false, and
report any truncated comment connection (`comments(first:10)`) rather than calling it complete. For Azure filter to non-terminal thread `status` values
(normally `active`/`pending`; omit `fixed`, `closed`, `wontFix` and `byDesign`). None → report the
PR is clear and stop. Preserve each thread's id, file/line context and comment chain. **Done
when:** the list of unresolved threads is in hand.
**Done when:** every provider page was fetched or its pagination/truncation is reported.

### 3. Work each thread, on its own confirmation
For each unresolved thread, in the order returned: show the file, line, and comment chain, propose
a fix (or ask what the human wants instead), and apply it only on a yes. **Done when:** every
thread has either been fixed and staged, or explicitly skipped with a stated reason.

### 4. Commit and resolve
Once at least one thread's fix is staged, invoke `/quenching:git:commit` to commit it (the command
must be available; otherwise stop before resolving anything). Then, per
thread actually fixed:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){thread{isResolved}}}' -F id=<thread id>
# azure-boards — `repository.url` comes from the PR JSON returned in step 1.
az rest --method patch \
  --url "<repository.url>/pullRequests/<pr-id>/threads/<thread-id>?api-version=7.1" \
  --body '{"status":"fixed"}' --output json
```
A thread that was skipped stays unresolved. Verify GitHub's `isResolved: true` or Azure's `status: fixed` after the update.
**Done when:** every fixed thread reads back resolved/fixed, and every skipped one is named in the
report as still open.
**Done when:** every fixed thread is verified resolved, and every skipped thread remains named.

### 5. Report
State how many threads were unresolved at the start, how many were fixed and resolved, how many
were skipped and why, and the commit(s) that carried the fixes. **Done when:** all four are named.

## Invariants

- Never resolve a thread that was skipped rather than fixed.
- Never batch-apply every thread's fix before any confirmation — one thread, one yes.
- Never invent a fix for a thread whose ask is unclear — ask the human instead.
- Never route an Azure PR through GitHub GraphQL, or a GitHub PR through Azure REST.
