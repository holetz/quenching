<Standard body. Anchor every rule to `file:line` evidence — that is what makes `resource`
derivable and non-fabricated. Favor structural markdown (headings, lists, tables).>

<!-- MOLD (quenching · standards frontmatter — do NOT copy this note into the doc):
     Every field above is required for a `/.knowledge/standards/**` doc (stricter than the generic
     concept-front). `resource` is the OKF "underlying asset" = the repo scope the standard
     governs, DERIVED from the doc's file:line anchors, NEVER invented. An empty or
     self-pointing `resource` is conformance theater (a standard that governs nothing is not a
     standard). STAMP = MERGE, NEVER CLOBBER; enum values stay canonical English
     (`authority: current`, never `vigente`).

     Bundle-level OKF constructs live at the standards ROOT, not per doc:
       • standards/index.md — the reserved listing (its "Current docs" tables are DERIVED
         between the BEGIN/END GENERATED markers). -->
