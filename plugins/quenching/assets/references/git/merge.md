# Merging a work branch home — the four strategies, and the caveats each carries

The strategies `/quenching:specs:conclude` offers once a spec's branch is reviewed and archived, what
each buys and costs, and how the worktree that held the work comes down afterward. Read
[conventions.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/git/conventions.md) first: the read-if-present
rule and the two prohibitions bind here too.

`cq components read <this file>` returns the heading index; `--sections` addresses one.

## Merge strategies

<!-- rules -->

Offered by `/quenching:specs:conclude`, never chosen for the human. State the trade in one line each.

**Every one of them runs in the checkout that already holds the base**, located first and merged
into in place:

```bash
git worktree list --porcelain                 # which checkout holds <base>
git -C <that path> <the chosen command>
```

**Never `git checkout <base>`.** From inside a worktree it fails outright —
`fatal: '<base>' is already used by worktree at …`, exit 128 — so it is broken for exactly the
isolation recommended above. `git -C` is one path, not two special cases: from a worktree it names
the main checkout, from the main checkout it names itself. When no checkout holds the base,
`/quenching:specs:conclude` says so and stops without merging rather than manufacturing one.

| Strategy | Command | What it buys | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **merge commit** *(default)* | `git merge --no-ff plan/<slug>` | every per-section commit stays on the base branch and every recorded subject resolves from it | one extra commit, and the base branch's history carries the spec's section-level detail |
| **squash** | `git merge --squash plan/<slug>` then commit | one commit on the base branch; the spec reads as a single change | **the per-section commits live only on the branch** — deleting it leaves every recorded subject resolving to nothing |
| **rebase** | `git rebase <base> plan/<slug>`, then fast-forward | linear history, per-section commits preserved | rewrites every commit it moves — but a subject is carried along by the rewrite, so the records survive it |
| **fast-forward** | `git merge --ff-only plan/<slug>` | nothing is rewritten and nothing is added | only possible when the base has not moved |

Whatever is chosen is recorded as `merge: {strategy, subject}` and stated in `## Outcome`, because
a future reader resolving a task's subject needs to know which of these happened.

### When there is no merge commit to name

<!-- rules -->

`fast-forward` and `rebase` create none, so the record carries an explicit none rather than a
fabricated pointer:

```yaml
merge:
  strategy: fast-forward
  subject: none — fast-forward creates no merge commit; the branch's commits ARE the
    base branch's history
```

`cq specs validate` reports the mismatched cases both ways — an
anchorless strategy carrying a real subject, and a merge-producing strategy carrying an explicit
none (`sp-bad-merge`).

### The squash caveat

<!-- rules -->

**The per-section commits survive only on the
branch.** So when squash is chosen, `/quenching:specs:conclude` offers **not** to delete the branch, and says
why. Keeping it costs a ref; deleting it silently turns every `subject:` field in the archived spec
into a reference that resolves to nothing.

### Rebase is no longer the strategy that destroys the record

<!-- rules -->

A subject survives a rebase's rewrite, so a rebased branch's
records still resolve. Rebase now sits on the same footing as the others, and the old warning
applies only to specs still carrying the sha form.

### The worktree is removed after a successful merge

<!-- rules -->

Once the merge exits 0,
`/quenching:specs:conclude` removes the worktree — from the base's checkout, because nothing removes the tree
it is standing in:

```bash
git -C <the base's checkout> worktree remove <the worktree path>
```

**Never `--force`.** `git worktree remove` refuses a tree holding modified or untracked files on
its own (`contains modified or untracked files`, exit 128), so the irreversible case is one git
already declines — no prompt buys safety here, and one always answered "yes" is only friction. A
clean tree leaves the disk silently; a refusal is reported with the path and git's own output, and
the worktree stays.

Three bounds: only after a merge verified at exit 0, never for an abandoned spec, and it does
**not** delete the branch — that stays the separate offer it already was.
