# Sources — scoping, bounded ingestion, unit extraction, attribution, dedup

The **per-doc** procedure (classify → stamp → index → log → glossary → self-check) is **not**
here — it lives once in
[`docs-add/homes.md`](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/knowledge-add/homes.md), which this
skill cites.

## What a source can be

- **Local files/folders** — read with `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`. Anchor each unit to `path:line`.
- **URLs** — fetched with `WebFetch`. Anchor each unit to the URL (+ heading/anchor when
  addressable).

## Bounded ingestion (discipline, not code)

<!-- rules -->

A source — especially a web source — is bounded **before** the first fetch:

- **Seed list.** The explicit set of files/URLs the user named. Ingest only what is on the seed
  list or reached from it under the rules below.
- **Host allowlist.** For web sources, the set of hosts a link may be followed to. Default:
  the hosts of the seed URLs only. A link to any other host is recorded, never fetched.
- **Page cap.** A hard maximum number of pages/files to fetch this run (state it in the plan).
  When the cap is hit, stop and **report what was left unfetched**.
- **One hop by default.** Follow links only one level from a seed, and only within the
  allowlist, up to the cap. Deeper crawls are a fresh, re-scoped run.
- **No auth walls, no downloads of binaries.** A binary (PDF/slide deck) becomes a `sidecar`
  extract per homes.md, not an ingested body.

State the seed list, allowlist, cap, and hop depth in the Step-3 plan so the user sees the
blast radius before the one OK.

<!-- rationale -->

This echoes the caps the upstream `enrich` enforced in code; here it is operator discipline.

## Extracting knowledge units

A **unit** is one concept — the granularity homes.md files as a single doc. Split the source
along its natural concept boundaries (a heading section, a table, a defined term, one rule,
one decision), not by page. Heuristics:

- One **rule / convention**, or a **decision with alternatives** → a `standards/` unit
  (unproven in the target's code ⇒ `authority: background`; there is no separate decision home).
- One **explanation / concept / term** → a `knowledge/` unit (+ a glossary entry if it names a
  repo-specific term).
- One **fact about a named external tool/lib/regulation** → a `reference/` unit.
- One **how-to / procedure** → a `documentation/how-to/` unit.
- **Data objects** (systems/schemas/tables) → `catalog/` units in the catalog path shape.

Keep units atomic — if a section carries two concepts, emit two units. Prefer **fewer,
well-scoped** units over shredding prose into fragments.

## Attribution

<!-- rules -->

Every minted doc records where it came from, in **two frontmatter fields that answer different
questions** — one written to be searched, one written to be read:

- **`source_uri:`** — the exact URI or path of the *source unit*. One value on one line: an
  absolute URL (`https://host/page#heading` when the heading is addressable) or the path as the
  user named the source, anchored where the unit starts (`docs/api/auth.md:120`). No prose, no
  parenthetical, no list.
- **`source:`** — unchanged, and still prose: which spec, person, or body of work originated the
  rule.

**Only `/quenching:knowledge:import` writes `source_uri:`.** No other command mints it, infers it, or backfills
it, and a doc with no external origin simply has no such key.

The body keeps its attribution line when the source is a stable URL, and that line carries **the
date the source was read**. `source_uri:` records *where*, and `timestamp:` already means
something else entirely — the doc's own last change.

Never present imported material as proven local practice: that is the `authority: background`
rule.

<!-- rationale -->

`source_uri:` is the key a later run greps for an exact match on, so an approximate value is worse
than no value at all.

`source:` stays prose because a bundle's own authored docs already use it that way, and importing
must not overload one key with two meanings.

Inventing a `source_uri:` where there is no external origin fabricates a provenance that never
existed. The shared frontmatter mold in
[`docs-add/homes.md`](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/references/knowledge-add/homes.md) deliberately
does not carry it, so the commands citing that mold are never invited to fill it in.

A URI with no age ages badly: a reader deciding whether a dead link matters needs to know how old
the reading was, and that costs a sentence in the body rather than a second key to parse.

## Dedup — within the source and against the bundle

<!-- rules -->

1. **Within the source.** Collapse two sections describing the same concept into one unit
   (merge their detail).
2. **Against the existing bundle.** Before minting, look for the doc that already covers this
   unit — in this order:

   1. **Exact, by origin.** `grep -rn 'source_uri: <the unit's URI>' knowledge/`. A hit is a doc
      minted from *this very unit* — on an earlier run, or earlier in this one when a previous
      slice already minted it. Two **overlapping seeds** are not this case: they carry different
      URIs, so this lookup can never match them.
   2. **Approximate, by concept.** No hit → `Grep` the bundle by title, slug, and any
      repo-specific term. A doc found this way covers the same concept from a *different* origin,
      or from none at all, so calling it the same concept is a judgement — present it as one.

   Either way the unit is a **MERGE** target — enrich that doc (fill missing keys, add detail,
   add the source link), never a second doc for the same concept. Record every MERGE-vs-mint
   decision in the plan, **and which of the two lookups produced it**.
3. **Glossary.** A term the source defines that the glossary already lists is a MERGE into the
   existing entry (sharpen/keep the link), per homes.md §Enriching the glossary.

<!-- rationale -->

The two lookups run in that order because they do not carry the same confidence. On the exact
one, nothing was recognised and nothing was judged: the URIs are equal or they are not. Two
overlapping seeds carry different URIs, and item 1 above has already collapsed them by prose
before it runs.

Recording which of the two lookups produced each MERGE-vs-mint decision is what lets the human
read an exact match and a resemblance as the different claims they are.

## Fan-out for scale

<!-- rules -->

For a large source, one `Task` sub-agent per **source slice** (a folder, a URL group)
returns **compact unit candidates** — `{home, type, path, one-line, source-anchor}`, never
full bodies. The orchestrator merges the candidate lists, runs the cross-slice dedup above,
and builds the single plan. Extraction/executor sub-agents may run on a **cheap model/effort**.
See the model policy in [README.md §cost-model](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/README.md#cost-model).

<!-- rationale -->

A cheap model is safe here because enrich deletes nothing, so a misclassification only misfiles a
doc (a correctable move), unlike `/quenching:knowledge:import-memory` where a misclassification deletes
a memory.
