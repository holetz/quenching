# Front mold — executor reference

<!-- rules -->

This file is the executor-facing projection of the binding architecture standard at
`docs/standards/architecture/front-mold.md`. The standard owns the contract; this reference gives
front command authors the compact reader surface and must not add a second minimum or a different
disposition rule.

## Contents

`cq components read <this file>` returns the heading index; `--sections` addresses one.

## The common minimum

Every local front carries the same outer shape:

| Surface | Required shape | Front-owned delta |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Declaration | owned tree and boundary, namespaced configuration home, applicability, read model, verifier, align, status and finding owner | tree, keys, payload and domain boundaries |
| `cq` route | normalized front entry point, `--help`, `--json`, exits `0`/`1`/`2`, explicit refusal, `doctor` and `status` | inventory, registry, build, render, readme, ratchet and other extra verbs |
| Align | probe, applicability, one plan/authorization, bounded writes, closing verifier and residual report | domain arbitration and repair decisions |
| Status | read-only payload, missing/refused/not-applicable states, stable finding codes/bands and closing owner | authoritative evidence rows |
| Translation | source remains canonical and the Codex surface mirrors it | platform spelling and generated path |

Do not turn this table into a generic runtime module or a second configuration schema. If a field is
owned by only one front, it remains in that front's contract.

## Route and applicability floor

The normalized route must keep `--help`, data-only `--json` stdout, stderr diagnostics, typed exits,
and explicit refusal for missing or invalid configuration. `doctor` verifies the declared surface;
`status` reads it without writing. Extra verbs are front-owned deltas and never weaken this floor.

Applicability is named before inventory. No signal means not applicable, an explicit scope means
skipped, and a present front with no findings is conformant. A refusal is reported as a refusal;
never invent a root, router, layer or namespace to make the front applicable.

## Disposition bands

Each front's `bands.md` maps every finding exactly once. The bands identify who may decide closure,
not the finding severity:

| Band | Decider | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mechanical | generated artifact and deterministic source | regenerate and re-run the verifier |
| Structural | contract plus one run authorization | apply a bounded repair and re-run the verifier |
| Judgement | human who owns target risk | report evidence and the closing command; do not edit automatically |

A front with no mechanical finding says so explicitly. Codes, evidence, severity, disposition and
closing command remain front-owned. A judgement command in a report is a hand-off, never an
invocation by the align or status body.

## Domain deltas

The mold does not erase domain meaning:

- design keeps its DTCG source, projections, optional Impeccable input, source arbitration and
  genre destinations;
- ops keeps its namespaced `opsRoot`, router, registry, inventory, lifecycle and `op-*` findings;
- proof keeps its namespaced proof root, layers, fixture reach, measured roots, floors, CI, order
  evidence and `pf-*` findings.

Read the binding architecture standard for the measured footprint, host decision and full delta
contract. This projection is updated only when that host changes, then translated to the Codex
surface; it never becomes an independent source of truth.
