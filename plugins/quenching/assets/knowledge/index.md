# `/docs/` — OKF knowledge bundle

The canonical knowledge tree of this repository, an **Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.1)** bundle,
and the source of its documentation site. Each **home** has a fixed name and a single purpose;
anyone moving between repositories that adopt this method finds the **same tree in the same
place**. This `index.md` is the bundle's front door and the site's home page — a reserved listing,
the only one that carries frontmatter, and only `okf_version`. Folder names and frontmatter keys
are canonical English kebab-case; all prose the agent authors follows the repo's declared
language — [standards/agents/communication.md](standards/agents/communication.md) owns that rule.

## Homes

* [standards/](standards/index.md) — how **WE** do it (current contracts/conventions), by subject; agreed-but-unproven rules sit here as `authority: background`
* [vision/](vision/index.md) — direction segmented by area, no deadline
* [tutorials/](tutorials/index.md) — learning-oriented pages ("get it running")
* [how-to/](how-to/index.md) — task-oriented recipes for a reader with a goal
* [explanation/](explanation/index.md) — how and why, for the site's reader
* [project/](project/index.md) — the manual for *this* repository: its commands, its automation, its layout
* [concepts/](concepts/index.md) — generic knowledge we hold (domain concepts, explanations, learnings); ships the fixed [glossary.md](glossary.md) term lookup
* [external/](external/index.md) — facts about what **WE CONSUME** (external, background)
* [catalog/](catalog/index.md) — our **data** / domain (`system/catalog/schema/table`)

## Boundaries (memorable summary)

- `standards/` = "how **WE** do it (current/active)"; an agreed-but-unproven rule sits here as `authority: background` (no separate decisions home).
- `concepts/` = "generic **understanding** we hold" (concepts/explanations; non-binding).
- `external/` = "facts about what **WE CONSUME** (external, background)".
- `catalog/` = "our **data** / domain".
- `tutorials/` `how-to/` `explanation/` `project/` = the **reader-facing** quadrants. A page you
  would publish for a human belongs to one of them; internal team understanding goes to
  `concepts/`, a current contract to `standards/`.
- The **task inbox** lives at `specs/backlog/`, **outside** this bundle (quenching-managed).
- `patterns` **is not a silo** — it dissolves into `standards/architecture/`.

**Resolving a term.** Unfamiliar repo word, acronym, or codename? Look it up in the glossary
first — [glossary.md](glossary.md), the A–Z lookup (one entry per term, linked to its full doc
when one exists): `grep -i '<term>' docs/glossary.md`.

## This bundle IS the site

The whole tree renders. The plugin ships a batteries-included **Zensical** setup at the repo root
(`zensical.toml`) — first installed by `quenching:knowledge:align`, then owned by the
**documentation family**: `plan`, `write`, `review` and `build`, conducted end to end by
`produce`.

- The generator points at the bundle root — `docs_dir = "docs"` in `zensical.toml`, kept at the
  repo root, **outside** the bundle. Never a dot-prefixed path: one builds an empty site silently.
- Each reserved `index.md` doubles as its section's landing page (the theme's
  `navigation.indexes` feature) — no separate landing file needed.
- Navigation is the explicit `nav` list in `zensical.toml`, generated from the tree by
  `cq knowledge nav`; a title a human wrote there survives regeneration.
- The markdown stays **generator-neutral**: no theme components, no raw HTML with theme classes,
  no attribute lists. The bundle has to read as well on a Git host and in a `grep` as it does on
  the site.

The full contract (homes, types, migration doctrine, conformance) lives in the `quenching`
skills' `references/`.
