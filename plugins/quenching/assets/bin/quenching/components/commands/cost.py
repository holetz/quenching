"""Measure the context a command's own reader will carry.

The measurement is a proxy, not a token counter: it uses UTF-8 bytes after frontmatter has been
removed, the same payload ``cq components read`` returns. A command body is always charged once;
each reference is charged either as the whole reference or as the section bodies named by ``§``.
Repeated citations are de-duplicated per command because a reader does not load the same file
twice in one turn.

The command is deliberately read-only. A ratchet is an input JSON document supplied by CI (or by
the repository's own proof tooling), and a regression is an error only when the measured total is
above its declared ``totalBytes`` ceiling. No baseline is invented or written by this verb.
