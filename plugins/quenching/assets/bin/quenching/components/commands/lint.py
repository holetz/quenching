"""lint — the per-command conformance checks, and the citation form a plugin's prose must use.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor components script.

Every check here is decidable FROM THE FILE. The doctrine's remaining tests — the no-op test,
sediment, sprawl, positive prescription — stay a human read in `/quenching:components:align` Stage 2, because
each needs a claim about behaviour that no parser can make. Adding a heuristic for one of them
would move the plugin's anti-fabrication boundary, not the tool's coverage.

    positive costs a command its place in the typed-only class, which is an argument; a
    false negative lets a real conductor stage be flagged typed-only and go silently
    inert, which is the failure this check exists to prevent.
