    **The delimiter is the document's own `## <Heading>` line** — the exact form the plural
    read already prints — so writing N sections needs no syntax the file does not already
    have, and read and write round-trip.

    **Self-describing or not at all.** A stream declares itself by OPENING on a canonical
    `## <Heading>`; anything else — prose first, a heading that resolves to nothing — makes it
    one raw body, and the empty list says so. The caller then writes it whole into the single
    heading it was given, which is the behaviour every caller had before this function
    existed, byte for byte. Once a stream has declared itself, every later `## ` in it must
    resolve too: there the unresolved name is a refusal, not a reason to re-read the whole
    stream as prose.

    **Cut by MEMBERSHIP, never by position** — each block's name goes through
    `resolve_heading_name` against the candidate set the caller passes in, exactly as
    `_match_heading` resolves a name typed on the command line, and an unresolved one comes
    back as `None` for the caller to refuse by name. The candidate set is an argument for the
    reason `/.knowledge/standards/code/canonical-set-parsing.md` gives: the cases prove the
    function that ships, not a copy of its rule.

    **A fenced block is never read as a heading** — the rule `parse_sections` and the
    components reader already hold, and the one that keeps a `## Design` inside a ```` ``` ````
    example from cutting the body that quotes it.

    Deliberately NOT `parse_sections`: that reader answers a different question — one entry
    per heading, keyed, three-state — and it collapses a repeated heading onto the first.
    Here the repeat is the finding, so the blocks stay a list and every one of them survives.

    **The edit is one `#` prepended to one line, and that is the design, not an economy.**
    `parse_sections` promotes every `## X` to a top-level section and keeps `###`+ with its
    parent, so demoting the heading is exactly what moves the body — no lines are cut, moved or
    re-emitted, which is what makes "the text is preserved byte for byte" a property of the
    operation rather than a claim to be tested. Routing this through `upsert_section` instead
    would re-splice the HOST in canonical position and could reorder a document whose sections
    are out of schema order, for an edit that never needed to move anything.

    **The host is the nearest canonical section ABOVE the stray, and never one named by the
    caller.** Position in the document is the strongest evidence of intent: the stray was
    written *inside* a body and only became a sibling because of its heading level. A stray
    with nothing canonical above it has no honest host, and `None` is the refusal — inventing
    one would give the text an owner its author never chose.
