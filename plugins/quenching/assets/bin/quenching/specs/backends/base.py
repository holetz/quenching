    THE INTERFACE IS THE DOCUMENT, NOT THE VERBS. `status`, `show`, `section`, `task`,
    `discover`, `promote` and `validate` are shared code layered on the five primitives
    below — they are not methods each backend reimplements. That is what makes "every
    backend behaves identically" provable by construction rather than by hoping three
    parsers agree: the canonical markdown document is the contract, the derivation of
    stages, gates, records and tasks happens once, and a backend's only job is to produce
    that document and to store it again.

    A backend is therefore free to serialise natively — `## Tasks` as sub-issues, sections
    as fields — provided it reassembles the canonical document on read. The hybrid
    serialisation lives inside each external implementation, exactly where it belongs, and
    it can never drift the JSON the CLI prints.

    Granular reading is unaffected by this split, because the cost it addresses is the
    agent's context and not I/O: `section` hands back the headings asked for whether or not
    the backend had to fetch the whole document to find them."""
