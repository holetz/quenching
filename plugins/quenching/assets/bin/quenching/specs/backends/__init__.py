"""The spec backends, and the one factory that opens the declared one.

`open_backend` and its cache live in the package `__init__` because they are the package's
whole public surface: every caller wants `from quenching.specs.backends import open_backend`,
and this is the ONLY place that may know the external implementations at once.

This is therefore the one directory under `quenching/` that is a regular package rather than a
PEP 420 namespace one — an `__init__.py` that carries the factory, never an empty file added
for its own sake."""
