"""The executor's two verbs — `task` and `discover`.

`task` flips a checkbox MECHANICALLY and records the anchor of the commit that implements it;
`--uncheck --reason` reopens a task and records why in `## Discoveries`;
`--descope` closes a task as deliberately out of scope and records why in `## Outcome`;
`discover` appends one line to `## Discoveries`. Both are written during a build, and both exist
so nothing does string surgery on a spec from the caller's side."""

    after five failures with no trace of why.

    `--descope` writes a checked box with a visible `descoped:` suffix and appends the reason
    to `## Outcome`. It is a closed task, not a blocked one: `promote --outcome done` can
