"""One rendering of one finding list — the operator's report.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor OKF validator script, with ONE adjustment: `VERSION` is
imported from `quenching.common.version` rather than declared here.

The agent's proposal rendering (`_render_proposal`, feeding a hook's `additionalContext`) was
retired along with the `hook` mode it served.

`_split` is the severity partition every caller branches on, and it is why this pillar
never grew a refusal step: findings are errors or warnings, and the exit code
`quenching.common.output` names is `OK` or `FINDINGS` and nothing else.
