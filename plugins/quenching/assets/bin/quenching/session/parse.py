"""The streaming parser — one pass over a transcript, and the honesty it owes.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor session script, whose module docstring carried the four sections
below unchanged.

WHAT A TRANSCRIPT HOLDS
-----------------------
One JSONL file per session at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`, one
JSON object per line. The fields this tool reads, all verified against live sessions in
this repo rather than assumed:

  type              "user" | "assistant" | "attachment" | "system" | ...
  uuid              stable per record; the dedup key
  timestamp         ISO-8601
  sessionId, cwd, gitBranch, version
  attributionSkill  THE command a turn belongs to, e.g. "quenching:specs:develop"
  attributionPlugin the plugin that owns it, e.g. "quenching"
  message.content   str, or a list of blocks: text | thinking | tool_use | tool_result

THE TWO ENTRY FORMS, AND WHY ATTRIBUTION BEATS BOTH
---------------------------------------------------
A command is reached two ways, and each leaves a *different* mark:

  typed   a user turn whose content string carries a `<command-name>` block
  skill   an assistant `tool_use` block named `Skill`, whose input names the command

Detecting only the first makes every conducted stage invisible. But neither mark tells you
what the command then *did* — they are both single points, and the work is a span.

`attributionSkill` covers both: every turn a command drives carries the command's name,
including turns inside a stage a conductor invoked. The invoking `Skill` call is attributed
to the **caller** and the stage's own turns to the **callee**, so a command is found even
when its entry mark fell outside a compacted window.

WHAT ATTRIBUTION IS NOT: A SPAN
-------------------------------
It is a *most-recently-entered* pointer. It is set on entry and **never cleared on return**
— measured across all 43 Skill stages in an 86-transcript corpus: attribution returns to
the conductor **once**, never returns to any command 36 times, and jumps to a third command
6 times.

The consequence is not academic. In the session that answered this spec's own go/no-go,
`/specs:develop` invoked `/specs:isolate` as a stage; isolate finished at its "Isolated."
turn, and the conductor's next five `AskUserQuestion` calls — its own spec-shape bank — are
still stamped with the stage label `specs:isolate`. Reported naively that is "the isolation stage asked
the human five questions", which is false and entirely plausible.

There is no end marker in the transcript to fix this with. Inventing one would manufacture
findings, so this tool does the other thing: it **detects and names the misread**. A command
entered as a stage whose caller never regained attribution is marked `closed: false`, and
every count on it is reported as an upper bound that may include the caller's own work. That
is `/.docs/standards/quality/parse-honesty.md` applied to a pointer instead of a parser — name
the *misread*, never the *consequence*.

So the entry marks are read for *how a command was reached and with what arguments*, and
attribution for *what it plausibly cost*, with the honesty flag attached.

PARSE HONESTY
-------------
Per `/.docs/standards/quality/parse-honesty.md`: this tool narrows a transcript into a
command model, so it must be able to say what it could not read. A line that fails to
parse is counted and reported as an anomaly ahead of the content, because "no commands
found" and "I could not read this file" look identical in a report and lead to opposite
actions.
