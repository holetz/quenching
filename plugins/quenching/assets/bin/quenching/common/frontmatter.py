"""The one frontmatter parser — the union of the three that preceded it.

`/docs/standards/code/frontmatter-parser.md` owns the comment rule, the canonical case list and
the anomaly set. Until this module it also owned a lockstep obligation — EDIT ALL THREE, OR NONE —
resting on a premise stated in the pre-refactor specs script: each script installed standalone
into a target repo's `.claude/hooks/`, "so none may import the others". Nothing installs any
more, so the premise is gone and the three copies collapse into this one.

NORMALIZING UPWARD, NOT PICKING A WINNER
----------------------------------------
The three never read the same YAML subset, and no two read the same one:

    form                          specs   skills   okf
    key: scalar, quotes, comment    yes     yes     yes
    inline list  [a, b]             yes     yes     no  — kept the literal "[a, b]"
    block list   - item             yes     yes     no  — read as ""
    block record (indented k: v)    yes     no      no
    flow map     {a: b}             yes     no      no  — kept the literal "{a: b}"
    block scalar | / >              no      yes     no  — kept the bare indicator

Nobody read the union: `specs` read records and flow maps but no block scalars, `skills` the
reverse. This parser reads every row, so the `knowledge` pillar (the pre-refactor OKF validator
script) gains the four forms it used to flatten and `components` (the pre-refactor components
script) gains records and flow maps.

WHAT THAT COSTS, DELIBERATELY
-----------------------------
`frontmatter_anomalies` had three divergent bodies, each a carve-out for what its own parser could
not read: `okf` reported every indented run because it read none of them, `skills` exempted block
lists and `hooks`, `specs` tested its own parse result. Only the last criterion survives a parser
that reads everything — **an anomaly is a key the parser could not turn into a value** — so
`knowledge` and `components` now report FEWER anomalies than they did. Nothing became invisible:
they stopped denouncing forms they can now read.
