"""The one exit-code contract, and the four doors a run leaves by.

    0  ok        the verb answered
    1  findings  the verb answered, and what it found fails the gate
    2  refusal   the verb did not answer, and says why

Before this module the contract was declared in three docstrings and implemented in none: only
`session.py` named the three steps as constants, `okf-validate.py` had no refusal step at all
(not one `return 2` in 1,372 lines), and the three scripts disagreed on the trivial case of being
run with no subcommand — 1, 2 and 0 respectively, from the same contract. Naming the steps here
is what turns the contract into something a caller can branch on, which is what every command
body already assumes it is doing.

A REFUSAL IS NOT A FINDING. The distinction is the whole reason the ladder has three steps rather
than two: `1` says the verb looked and did not like what it saw, `2` says the verb declined to
look. A conductor that cannot tell them apart retries the one case that will never succeed.
