<Doc body. Favor STRUCTURAL markdown — headings, lists, tables (OKF SHOULD).>

<!-- MOLD (claude-quenching · generic concept frontmatter — do NOT copy this note into the doc):
     The OKF core requires `type` non-empty on every concept doc; `title`/`description`/
     `resource`/`timestamp` are OKF-recommended; `audience`/`authority`/`source`/`maintainer`
     are the method's extra keys (canonical English enums — a single `grep 'authority: current'`
     finds every contract across every repo).

     STAMP = MERGE, NEVER CLOBBER: fill a MISSING key, preserve a filled one and any third-party
     key (OKF consumers, a legacy `status:`, site generators). Field migration when aligning a
     legacy doc: `summary:` → `description:`, `updated:` → `timestamp:` (keep the original as an
     extra key if ambiguous). Identity is the file PATH (kebab-case, one concept per file); the
     folder carries the subject, so the filename does not repeat it. -->
