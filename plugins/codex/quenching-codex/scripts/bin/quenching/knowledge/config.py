"""What the target repo declares about this checker, and the two reads that find it.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor OKF validator script.

Config (target repo's `.claude/quenching.json` `shared.okfValidate`, over `.agents/hooks/hooks-config.json` + `hooks-config.local.json`, block
`okfValidate`): `warnAsError`, `ignoreGlobs`. An absent config uses the defaults below; an unreadable, invalid or non-object one is refused.
The file and directory keep the `hooks` name for the two keys that survive it — the plugin's
self-installed hook that once read the rest of this block (`enabled`, `blockOnFail`, `hardBlock`,
`deadlineMs`, `stopScan`) was retired, and `warnAsError`/`ignoreGlobs` stayed on the same config
surface rather than move, which would have been a breaking change of its own.

Trust note: this config is executable code with shell privileges. This pillar reads the touched
path/content and prints; it writes nothing. In **CLI mode** it additionally shells out to
`git log`/`git rev-parse` (read-only, timeout-bounded) for `stale-doc`. Version and review it like
infra.
