    argument is the title; the provider assigns the spec's identity when it stores the body.

    EVERY REFUSAL IS SETTLED BEFORE THE ONE `create_spec`, exactly as `cmd_section`'s stream
    write already does: `--complexity` is validated and the stdin stream is decomposed and
    checked before a single byte of the document is assembled, so a rejected capture leaves
    no orphaned issue behind on a backend like `github` that has no local undo.

    `sp-write-set-mismatch` does not apply here: unlike `section --write`, `new` declares no
    heading set on the command line — the stream IS the declaration, so a stream that never
    opens on a canonical heading has no single implied heading to fall back on and refuses
