"""doctor — the surface's shape, plus the report-only inventory of everything beside it.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor components script.

`lint` judges one command against the doctrine; `doctor` judges the surface as a whole, which
is where the front's convergence condition actually lives. Every finding carries a `remedy` the
sweep applies rather than invents, the same contract `cq specs doctor` already gives the specs
front.

WHAT REPLACED THE BIJECTION. This used to check that every command had exactly one mirrored
wrapper and vice versa. With one file per entry point there is no second half that can be
missing, duplicated, dangling, or misnamed, so `sk-orphan-skill`, `sk-dangling-wrapper`,
`sk-duplicate-wrapper`, `sk-wrapper-no-target` and `sk-path-mismatch` are deleted rather than
reinterpreted. The invariant that took their place is narrower and total: every command carries
a non-empty `description`, no two resolve to the same `/` path, and every segment is kebab-case.

The bijection did catch a real class of error — a command minted without a wrapper — and nothing
replaces it, because after the collapse that state cannot exist.
