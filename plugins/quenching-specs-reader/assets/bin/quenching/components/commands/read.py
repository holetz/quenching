"""read — N sections of any markdown file, in ONE call.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor components script. The rule itself is `quenching.components.sections`; this is
the verb over it — the heading index when nothing was asked for, the refusal that names an
absent section, and the `--rules-only` note that keeps a missing marker from becoming silence.
