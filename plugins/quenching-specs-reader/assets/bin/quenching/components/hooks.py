"""The frontmatter `hooks:` block, and the ladder checks that run over any `hooks` object.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor components script.

Two things live together here because they are the same rung read twice. `parse_frontmatter_hooks`
is the reader the generic parser deliberately does not have — it is the reason
`quenching.common.frontmatter.ANOMALY_EXEMPT_KEYS` names `hooks` at all — and
`hook_ladder_findings` is the one implementation both `lint` (a command's frontmatter block) and
`doctor` (the `settings.json` wiring) grade against, which is also what keeps those two verbs from
importing each other.

    """The frontmatter `hooks:` block — the scope ladder's NARROWEST rung, and the one
    `parse_frontmatter` structurally cannot see: it keeps top-level pairs only, so a
    nested block reads back as `""` and the rung was invisible to `lint` entirely.

    Returns `({event: [{"matcher": str, "hooks": [{...}]}]}, understood)`, shaped to
    match the `hooks` object in `settings.json` so the SAME ladder checks run over both
    without a second implementation.

    This grows ONE case, not a YAML implementation. It reads exactly what
    `assets/templates/automation/hook.md` shape 1 emits:

        hooks:
          PostToolUse:
            - matcher: "Write|Edit"
              hooks:

                  command: "python3 ..."
                  timeout: 10

    Anything else sets `understood` False and the caller WARNS rather than guessing —
    fail-open, because a parser that silently misreads a hook is worse than one that
    admits it cannot read it."""
