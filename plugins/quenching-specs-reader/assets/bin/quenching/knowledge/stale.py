"""Resource activity — the one measurement that asks git a question, and the two calls that ask it.

Moved verbatim out of the pre-refactor OKF validator script; only `parse_frontmatter`'s call
shape changed, from the `(fm, has_block, well_formed)` tuple to the bare dict
`quenching.common.frontmatter` returns. It emitted a `stale-doc` WARN until 2026-08-27; see
`validate.py`, which records the retirement where the call used to be.

**A FIGURE, NOT A VERDICT — and the difference is what this module exists to hold.** The
measurement is honest: the doc's `timestamp` against the last commit touching each entry of its
`resource:`. The verdict built on top of it was not. A `resource:` glob is deliberately wide
(`assets/**`, three named scripts), so what the comparison detects is ACTIVITY IN THE RADIUS OF
THE GLOB — never drift of the content the doc describes. Code moves under a rule that did not
change, and the doc is then reported as possibly wrong for being correct about something stable.

Measured on this repo, 2026-08-27: **50 of 95 docs** carried the warning. A signal more than half
the corpus raises is not read as a signal; it is scrolled past, and it takes the findings printed
beside it along.

So the number is published **per `resource:` entry**, with the interval, and no code beside it. A
reader who wants to know which docs sit next to the most movement gets a ranking; nobody is told a
doc is wrong on evidence that cannot say so.

The two subprocess calls are this pillar's own and NOT `quenching.common.git._git`: `_git`
falls back to `cwd="."` for a directory that does not exist, where these must answer
"no git facts" for that path, and `_is_git_checkout` reads the exit code and the stdout
together. Left as they were rather than folded into the shared helper.
